# Devices

## ZKTeco

[Homepage](https://www.zkteco.com/en/)

The ZKTeco devices use a SDK, in this POC was used **SDK-Ver6.3.1.34** available from [this link](https://desarrollo.zktecolatinoamerica.com/downloads) <sup>(Registration required)</sup>.

# Installation

Download the SDK zip file, decompress and move to your current architecture  (64Bit) in my case, register the SDK in your windows registry by running **Register_SDK_x64.bat** script.
