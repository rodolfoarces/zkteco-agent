# Devices

## ZKTeko

[Homepage](https://www.zkteco.com/en/)

The ZKTeko devices use a SDK, in this POC was used **SDK-Ver6.3.1.37** available from [this link](https://www.zkteco.com/en/download_catgory/45.html)

# Installation

Download the SDK zip file, decompress and move to your current architecture  (64Bit) in my case, register the SDK in your windows registry by running **Register_SDK_x64.bat** script.
